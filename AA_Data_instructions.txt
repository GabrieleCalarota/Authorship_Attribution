1. Run `conda env create -f AA_Data.yml` to create the environment.
2. Run `conda activate AA_Data` to activate the environment.
3. Now, to add this environment to the list of available environments you'll
see in your Jupyter notebook, run:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name AA_Data --display-name "AA_Data"
4. Now run `jupyter notebook` to start your notebook.
5. In your notebook, select "Kernel -> Change kernel" and select
"AA_Data" as your kernel.

Now you'll be able to use all the libraries you'll need to complete the exercises!
